# Ratchet status — why is nothing ready?

A **read-only** diagnosis. Never create, edit, label, branch, or commit — only
report. The goal: turn "backlog drained" into a specific, actionable picture.

## Steps

1. **Count open issues by state.**
   `gh issue list --state open --limit 200 --json number,title,labels` and
   tally `state:ready / in-progress / in-review / changes-requested / blocked /
   draft`.

2. **If there is pickable work** (`state:ready` or `state:changes-requested`),
   say so and stop — the queue is fine; the agent should just pick (run
   `/ratchet-next`). No further diagnosis needed.

3. **If nothing is pickable, find the cause(s):**
   - **Drafts** — list `state:draft` issues. They lack testable acceptance
     criteria (`- [ ]`), so they are unpickable by design. For each, name the
     `plan/*.md` slug that produced it (or the issue) that needs criteria added.
   - **Blocked chains** — for each `state:blocked` issue, read `Blocked by #N`
     and check whether the blockers are open. If a blocker is itself a draft,
     that draft is the **root** freezing the chain — call it out.
   - **Blocked cycles** — build the graph from those `Blocked by #N` links (open
     `state:blocked` issue → each open blocker) and look for a loop: follow the
     links from each blocked issue and if you return to an issue already on the
     current path, that set is a **deadlock cycle** — no member can ever unblock,
     and `unblock-dependents` never fires for any of them. Report each cycle,
     naming every issue in it (e.g. "#7 → #9 → #7"). This is the runtime twin of
     the `plan-sync` cycle gate: the gate stops cycles born in one sync, this
     catches any that already reached issues. A cycle is a **root** cause —
     surface it above ordinary blocked chains.
   - **In-flight** — note any `state:in-progress` (claimed; maybe abandoned →
     `sweep-stale-claims` will requeue) or `state:in-review` (waiting on a human
     to merge/review — the loop advances when they do).
   - **Unmerged plans** — `gh pr list --head ratchet/planning --state open`. If a
     planning PR is open, its plan files have NOT become issues yet — merging it
     creates them.
   - **Uncommitted plans** — `git status --short plan/`. Untracked/modified
     plan files aren't on the planning PR yet; `/ratchet-plan` will place them.

4. **Recommend the single best next action**, e.g.:
   - "Merge planning PR #52 → creates 3 issues, then `/ratchet-next`."
   - "Issues #18–#22 are draft (no criteria). Add `- [ ]` criteria to their plan
     files and re-plan, or they'll never be picked."
   - "All open issues are blocked on #18 (a draft). Fix #18 first; the chain
     unblocks itself on merge."
   - "#7 and #9 block each other (deadlock cycle). Break one `Blocked by` link —
     edit a plan file to drop the edge and re-sync — or the pair is frozen forever."
   - "Queue genuinely empty — plan new work with `/ratchet-plan`."

## Hard rules

- Read-only. Never change labels, issues, files, branches, or anything else.
- Always end with the one most useful next action, not just a state dump.
