// sweep-stale-claims.mjs — the pure decision core of the sweep-stale-claims
// workflow. Given one issue's current state plus the freshness signals already
// fetched from the API, decide whether the sweep returns it to state:ready,
// whether its claim ref should be deleted, and the human-readable comment that
// explains why. Kept out of the workflow YAML so it can be unit-tested without
// the network (see sweep-stale-claims.test.mjs) and so what CI runs and what the
// tests assert can never diverge — the same split unblock-dependents uses for
// scripts/criteria.mjs.
//
// Zero dependencies. Node 20+ (ESM).

// Freshness for the time-based states is the shared lease rule (sweep-lease.mjs,
// added for the renewable-lease heartbeat): the freshest proof of life among the
// branch's last commit, a heartbeat comment, and the claim event. Reusing it here
// keeps "is this claim alive?" defined in exactly one place.

// pages. Both come from the shared client — see scripts/gh-api.mjs.
