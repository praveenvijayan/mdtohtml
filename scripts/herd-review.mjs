// herd-review.mjs — the ratchet-herd review-verdict reactor. Verification ends a
// worker at the terminal status "ready-for-review" (herd-verify.mjs); nothing
// revisits it, so a human's Request Changes review on that PR used to fall on the
// floor in herd mode — no component polled the PR's review decision, and the
// worker that opened it had already exited (observed on PR #188 / issue #165:
// review submitted CHANGES_REQUESTED, label stuck at state:in-review with no
// rework dispatched). This stage closes that open circuit: each poll it reads the
// review decision of every tracked, ready-for-review PR and, on CHANGES_REQUESTED,
// dispatches exactly one rework worker on the issue's existing branch — the same
// role a human plays in chat mode when they notice the rejection and run
// /ratchet-next. It is detection + dispatch only; it never re-implements rework.
//
// Two signals gate a dispatch, and both must hold:
//   1. the PR's `reviewDecision` is CHANGES_REQUESTED (an APPROVED/COMMENTED/absent
//      verdict dispatches nothing), and
//   2. the issue still carries `state:changes-requested`.
// Signal 2 is the per-rejection dedup. `reviewDecision` stays CHANGES_REQUESTED
// until a *new* review is submitted, so it does not change when the rework worker
// pushes its fix — polling it alone would re-dispatch (and eventually escalate) a
// PR that is merely awaiting re-review. The label is authoritative: the
// review-verdict workflow (0098) sets state:changes-requested on each rejection,
// and the rework worker flips it back to state:in-review when its rework lands
// (AGENTS.md step 6). While the label reads changes-requested the rework is
// outstanding; once it reads in-review this stage stands down until the next
// rejection. A live worker on the entry is likewise left alone — a rework already
// in flight is never dispatched twice.
//
// A rework here counts against the same `entry.attempts` / `config.reworkCap`
// budget the monitor and verify stages share; at the cap the PR is escalated
// naming it and the cap, never re-dispatched. Like the rest of herd, this stage
// NEVER merges, approves, closes, or labels — the flip back to state:in-review is
// the dispatched worker's job, not the supervisor's. Every outside-world call is
// injectable, so it runs offline in tests. Zero dependencies.
