// herd-verify.mjs — the ratchet-herd PR verification stage. The monitor marks a
// worker "awaiting-verification" once its run opened a PR (head agent/issue-<N>);
// this stage runs *deterministic* checks on that PR and routes the outcome. It
// makes no scope or quality judgment — that stays with the human. The three
// deterministic outcomes:
//   1. conflicts (`mergeable` CONFLICTING / `mergeStateStatus` DIRTY) -> dispatch
//      exactly one rework (merge origin/main, resolve, re-run GATES.md gates,
//      push), counted toward `reworkCap`. A PR still conflicting after that, or
//      one already at `reworkCap`, is escalated instead of re-dispatched.
//   2. body missing `Closes #<N>` or a gates section (text checks only) ->
//      escalate; the supervisor never edits a PR body.
//   3. clean (no conflicts, `Closes #<N>` and a gates section present) ->
//      escalate "PR #X ready for review" — the supervisor's terminal act.
// Mergeability GitHub is still computing (`mergeable` not yet MERGEABLE and no
// conflict) is deferred to the next poll rather than mis-classified.
//
// Like the rest of herd, this stage NEVER merges, approves, closes, or labels a
// PR — it only reads (`gh pr view`), dispatches reworks, and escalates. Every
// outside-world call is injectable, so it runs offline in tests. Zero deps.
