## PR size limit (agent PRs)

Enforced server-side by the `pr-gates` workflow (`scripts/pr-size-check.mjs`) on
every `agent/issue-*` PR — a PR over either threshold fails the check and the
red message repeats the split-and-requeue protocol from AGENTS.md step 3. Tune
the numbers here; they default to the manual's ~400 changed lines / ~6 files.

- max_changed_lines: 400
- max_changed_files: 6
- exclude_paths: [package-lock.json, pnpm-lock.yaml, yarn.lock, Cargo.lock, poetry.lock, go.sum, ratchet-manifest.json]

`exclude_paths` accepts comma-separated path patterns. The lockfiles above are
excluded by default even if this line is omitted; add generated artifacts here
when they should not count toward review-size limits.

Also excluded by default, alongside the lockfiles: the generated skill mirrors
`.claude/skills/**` and `plugin/skills/**`. Skills have one canonical source
under `.agents/skills/` (which still counts) and two mirrors regenerated by
`setup.sh`, so one real skill edit ships three changed files; excluding the
mirrors keeps the gate counting the single canonical change.

### Exclude-pattern matching rules

A pattern is matched against each changed file's full repo-relative path (the
whole path must match, not a prefix). These semantics are **not** gitignore's —
read them before writing a pattern:

- **`*` matches within a single path segment only — it never crosses a `/`.**
  So `*.min.js` matches `app.min.js` but **not** `dist/app.min.js`; write
  `**/*.min.js` (or `dist/**`) to reach nested files. Use `**` to cross
  directory separators.
- **A bare filename (no `/` and no `*`) matches that file at any depth.** So
  `Cargo.lock` matches both `Cargo.lock` and `crates/api/Cargo.lock` — this is
  why the default lockfile names catch nested lockfiles without a `**/` prefix.
- **A pattern containing `/` is anchored at the repo root.** So `docs/report.md`
  matches only the top-level file, and `generated/**` matches everything under a
  root-level `generated/` directory.

# Project preferences & conventions

## Coding conventions
- (e.g.) TypeScript strict mode; no `any`. Prefer composition over inheritance.
- (e.g.) Conventional Commits for all commit messages.

## Review preferences
- (e.g.) Small PRs only; one issue per PR. Tests required for new behaviour.

## Tech decisions (settled)
- (e.g.) State management: XState. HTTP: native fetch, no axios.

## Always / never
- Always: (e.g.) add a failing test before implementing a bug fix.
- Never: (e.g.) introduce a new dependency without noting why in the PR.

## Glossary
- (term) — (one-line definition)

MEMORY.md — distilled project knowledge. A CACHE, NOT A LOG.

Rules:
- The agent PROPOSES entries here as part of a PR; a human approves them on merge.
  Never write to this file silently.
- An entry earns its place only if it saves a future agent from re-reading
  history. Raw detail lives in issues/PRs/commits — link to them, don't copy them.
- Each entry is 1–2 lines and cites its source: (#123) or (PR #456).
- Keep it small and current. Prune obsolete entries with /ratchet-memory — the
  full history in closed issues/PRs/git means pruning never loses information.
- Group by area. If this file outgrows ~300 lines, that's a signal to compact.

ARCHITECTURE.md — a COARSE, machine-generated map of this codebase. The agent
reads it at the start of every issue to orient and to SCOPE its file reads,
instead of exploring blind. Generated by /ratchet-init and refreshed by
/ratchet-map. Agents propose edits here in the same PR when their work changes
the structure (a new module, a moved directory) — reviewed like code.

RULES (these keep the map honest; a stale map is worse than none):
- COARSE ONLY: directories and their responsibilities, major components by role.
- NEVER record line numbers, function signatures, or dependency versions
  (those live in the code and the manifest, and rot fast).
- Repo-relative paths only — never absolute machine paths.
- Ignore generated/vendor dirs (build/, dist/, target/, node_modules/,
  .dart_tool/, ios/Pods/, vendor/, __pycache__/, .next/, package caches).
- PROVISIONAL: when the map disagrees with the code, the code wins — fix the map.
