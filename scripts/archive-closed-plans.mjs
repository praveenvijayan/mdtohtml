// archive-closed-plans.mjs — the dedicated "archive closed plans" sweep.
// Moves every plan/*.md whose issue is CLOSED into plan/done/, so the active
// plan/ directory stays a map of live work while the history is preserved on
// disk (and in git). Noise otherwise grows linearly with project age.
//
// Safe by design: plan-sync resolves every blocker through the issue's
// `<!-- plan-id: slug -->` marker, not the file's presence, so archiving a file
// never breaks a `blocked_by` pointing at it (see plan-sync + its regression
// test). plan-sync also never scans plan/done/, so an archived file is inert.
//
// Run:  node scripts/archive-closed-plans.mjs
// It only MOVES files into plan/done/ — it never commits or pushes. Review the
// moves (git shows them as renames) and commit them like any other change, so
// the archive lands as one reviewable commit through the normal PR flow.
//
// Zero dependencies. Requires Node 20+ (global fetch). Token/repo resolution is
// identical to plan-sync: GITHUB_TOKEN | GITHUB_PAT (.env or env), and
// GITHUB_REPOSITORY = "owner/repo".
