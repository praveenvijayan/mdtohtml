// run-gates.mjs — run the verification gates declared in GATES.md, in order,
// fail-fast. This is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for the gate commands: the
// local verify step (AGENTS.md step 4) and the `pr-gates` CI workflow both
// invoke this script, so the commands can never drift between a developer's
// machine and the PR check.
//
// Behaviour:
//   - Parses the gates table from GATES.md (the `| Order | Gate | Command |`
//     rows), preserving order.
//   - Runs each gate's command in order, stopping at the FIRST failure.
//   - A gate whose command starts with `TODO:` has no command yet: it is
//     SKIPPED with a visible notice and never counted as passed. When EVERY gate
//     is a TODO (or no gates exist at all), the run is vacuous — zero real gates
//     executed — and the process exits non-zero so the check is red in the PR
//     checks list, distinguishable from a run that verified real gates (#89).
//   - A `|` inside a command runs as part of the command, not as a column
//     break, as long as it sits inside backticks (`npm test | tee log`) or is
//     escaped (`\|`). A row the parser cannot split unambiguously (unbalanced
//     backticks, or a stray pipe that changes the column count) FAILS the run
//     naming the row — a truncated command prefix is never executed.
//   - On failure the process exits non-zero and the failing gate's NAME is
//     written to the CI check summary and emitted as an error annotation, so a
//     red check names the gate that broke.
//
// Zero dependencies. Requires Node 20+. Run:  node scripts/run-gates.mjs
// Override the file for testing with GATES_FILE=/path/to/GATES.md.
