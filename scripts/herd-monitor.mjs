// herd-monitor.mjs — the ratchet-herd monitor. A worker is done when its process
// exits, and the exit *shape* decides what happens next:
//   1. exit 0 + an open PR with head `agent/issue-<N>` -> hand off to PR
//      verification (status "awaiting-verification"; issue #0055 acts on it).
//   2. exit 0 + no PR -> escalate with the log tail quoted, so the agent's own
//      report (drained queue, blocked question) reaches the human, not a retry.
//   3. nonzero exit OR crash (unknown code) -> a failure: bump `attempts` and
//      relaunch via the adapter's `resume` command (its `launch` when no
//      `resume` is configured — normalizeConfig resolves that).
//   4. attempts has reached `reworkCap` -> escalate and never retry again.
// PR takes precedence: a run that opened a PR then exited 0 is a hand-off. A
// "crash" is any dead worker with no recorded exit 0 — which also covers a
// supervisor restart that lost the exit event, so an orphan is safely retried
// (ratchet-next makes re-dispatch idempotent) rather than mis-escalated. Every
// state change prints ONE compact status line. Like the rest of herd, the
// supervisor never merges, approves, or closes. It has exactly ONE permitted
// deletion (plan 0178): a claim ref agent/issue-<N> it watched its own worker
// create, once that worker has died at the rework cap with no PR — it deletes
// that one ref and requeues the issue (auto-recovery), then touches nothing
// else. A ref it did not observe its own worker create is never deleted here.
// Every outside-world call is injectable, so the monitor runs offline in tests.
// Zero dependencies.
