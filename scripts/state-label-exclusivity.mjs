// state-label-exclusivity.mjs — orchestration for the state-label-exclusivity
// workflow. State labels are a state machine: an open issue must carry at most
// one `state:*` label at a time. The claim/rework instructions add a new state
// label symmetrically with removing the previous one, but a single missed
// removal used to survive every later flip permanently (observed on #181:
// state:ready lingered next to state:in-review, so the pick step saw an
// in-review issue as pickable). This closes the loop GitHub-side: when a
// `state:*` label is added to an issue that already carries a different one, the
// newest label wins and the stale one is stripped, with no agent discipline
// load-bearing — the same labeled-event pattern as unblock-dependents.
//
// Non-state labels (`priority:*`, `herd`, anything else) are never touched: the
// rewrite keeps every non-state label and only ever drops the *other* state
// labels, never the one just added, so an issue is never left with zero state
// labels. All logic lives here so it can be regression-tested against an
// in-memory API (see state-label-exclusivity.test.mjs); the workflow YAML is
// only the trigger. Zero dependencies. Node 20+ (ESM).
